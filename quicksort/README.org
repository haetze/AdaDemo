This folder does not really implement quicksort. 
It's main purpose was to start to play around with the Spark subset and the provers.
=gnatprove -P quicksort.gpr -U --prover=all= fully discharges all VC's.
CVC4 was not sufficient for me. 
Also many Assertions are not necessary, I kept them as a record for myself.
